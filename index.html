            <p> I am Oscar Jimenez. I graduated with a degree in Business Administration/Business Law and was planning to become a lawyer when I discovered coding. I worked as an analyst for medical device companies before discovering my passion for web-development. I was introduced to programming in my previous rolls and realized the critial thinking and problem solving appealed to me.
            </p>
      
            <p>I began teaching myself web-developing skills in late 2016 and began taking on freelancing jobs in late 2017. My constant drive to learn new skills fit perfectly with programming. I love learning new skills and perfecting my craft. Programming to me is the perfect career because of the continuous learning involved. It is such a fullfilling career. I decided to join the UCLA Coding Bootcamp to expand my skills and get help with the backend portion of web-development. I look forward to learning new skills and joining a great company where I can not only apply my skills bit also continue my learning.  
            </p>
      
            <p>For fun, I like playing video games, board games, Dungeons & Dragons, and adventuring outdoors. I challenge my self physically by competing in obstacle course races, going on long difficult hikes, mountain biking, and boxing. I love to read and learn from people who I look up to. One of my favorite books I have recently read are Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and The 4-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss. I have been descibed by friends as motivating because I never give up and dont let them give up on goals and challenges set infront of us.
